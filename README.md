# Project Title
Genetic Variation in miRNA Primary Transcripts

# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

# Prerequisites
The R code requires a specific directory structure. Create an R project (anywhere) from this directory and follow the structure below:

     ├── miRNA                   # The project directory.
         ├── R                   # The folder containing .R files
         ├── VCF                 # The folder containing VCF files. All VCF files for a specific 
                                   subpopulation must be placed in a folder named as the population code.
         ├── miRNA.gff3          # The file containing miRNA genome coordinates.

# Running the analysis
Simply follow main.R to run the analysis.
